#   Data Structures

This lesson will introduce you to several useful data structures built on the door, then discuss how the compiler handles types and the sample.

##  Key Data Structures and Molds

`++map`s are a versatile way to store and access data, but they are far from the only useful pattern.  `++map`s were documented in [the previous module](./K-doors.md).

### `tree`

We use `tree` to make a binary tree data structure in Hoon, e.g., `(tree @)` for a binary tree of atoms.

There are two kinds of `tree` in Hoon:

1. The null tree `~`.
2. A non-null tree which is a cell with three parts.
    1. The node value.
    2. The left child of the node.
    3. The right child of the node.
    
    Each child is itself a tree.  The node value has the face `n`, the left child has the face `l`, and the right child has the face `r`.  The following diagram provides an illustration of a `(tree @)` (without the faces):

```
          12
        /    \
      8       14
    /   \    /   \
   4     ~  ~     16
 /  \            /  \
~    ~          ~    ~
```

Hoon supports trees of any type that can be constructed in Hoon, e.g.: `(tree @)`, `(tree ^)`, `(tree [@ ?])`, etc.  Let's construct the tree in the diagram above in the dojo, casting it accordingly:

```
> `(tree @)`[12 [8 [4 ~ ~] ~] [14 ~ [16 ~ ~]]]
{4 8 12 14 16}
```

Notice that we don't have to insert the faces manually; by casting the [noun](/docs/glossary/noun/) above to a `(tree @)` Hoon inserts the faces for us.  Let's put this noun in the dojo subject with the face `b` and pull out the tree at the left child of the `12` node:

```
> =b `(tree @)`[12 [8 [4 ~ ~] ~] [14 ~ [16 ~ ~]]]

> b
{4 8 12 14 16}

> l.b
-find.l.b
find-fork-d
```

This didn't work because we haven't first proved to Hoon that `b` is a non-null tree.  A null tree has no `l` in it, after all.  Let's try again, using `?~` to prove that `b` isn't null.  We can also look at `r` and `n`:

```
> ?~(b ~ l.b)
{4 8}

> ?~(b ~ r.b)
{14 16}

> ?~(b ~ n.b)
12
```

#### Find and Replace

Here's a program that finds and replaces certain atoms in a `(tree @)`.

```hoon
|=  [nedl=@ hay=(tree @) new=@]
^-  (tree @)
?~  hay  ~
:+  ?:  =(n.hay nedl)
      new
    n.hay
  $(hay l.hay)
$(hay r.hay)
```

`nedl` is the atom to be replaced, `hay` is the tree, and `new` is the new atom with which to replace `nedl`.  Save this as `findreplacetree.hoon` and run in the dojo:

```
> b
{4 8 12 14 16}

> +findreplacetree [8 b 94]
{4 94 12 14 16}

> +findreplacetree [14 b 94]
{4 8 12 94 16}
```

### `set`

A `set` is rather like a `list` except that each entry can only be represented once.  As with a `map`, a `set` is typically associated with a particular type, such as `(set @ud)` for a collection of decimal values.  (`set`s also don't have an order, so they're basically a bag of unique values.)

`set` operations are provided by `++in`.  Most names are similar to `map`/`++by` operations when applicable.

[`++silt`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2l#silt) produces a `set` from a `list`:

```hoon
> =primes (silt ~[2 3 5 7 11 13])
```

`++put:in` adds a value to a `set` (and null-ops when the value is already present):

```hoon
> =primes (~(put in primes) 17)
> =primes (~(put in primes) 13)
```

`++del:in` removes a value from a `set`:

```hoon
> =primes (~(put in primes) 18)
> =primes (~(del in primes) 18)
```

`++has:in` checks for existence:

```hoon
> (~(has in primes) 15)
%.n
> (~(has in primes) 17)
%.y
```

`++tap:in` yields a `list` of the values:

```hoon
> ~(tap in primes)  
~[3 2 7 5 11 13 17]  
> (sort ~(tap in primes) lth)  
~[2 3 5 7 11 13 17]
```

`++run:in` applies a function across all values:

```hoon
> (~(run in primes) dec)  
{10 6 12 1 2 16 4}
```

#### Example:  Cartesian Product

Here's a program that takes two sets of atoms and returns the [Cartesian product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) of those sets.  A Cartesian product of two sets `a` and `b` is a set of all the cells whose head is a member of `a` and whose tail is a member of `b`.

```hoon
|=  [a=(set @) b=(set @)]
=/  c=(list @)  ~(tap in a)
=/  d=(list @)  ~(tap in b)
=|  acc=(set [@ @])
|-  ^-  (set [@ @])
?~  c  acc
%=  $
  c  t.c
  acc  |-  ?~  d  acc
       %=  $
         d  t.d
         acc  (~(put in acc) [i.c i.d])
       ==
==
```

Save this as `cartesian.hoon` in your urbit's pier and run in the dojo:

```
> =c `(set @)`(sy ~[1 2 3])

> c
{1 2 3}

> =d `(set @)`(sy ~[4 5 6])

> d
{5 6 4}

> +cartesian [c d]
{[2 6] [1 6] [3 6] [1 4] [1 5] [2 4] [3 5] [3 4] [2 5]}
```

### `unit` Redux (and `vase`)

We encountered the `unit` briefly as a tool for distinguishing null results from actual zeroes:  using a `unit` allows you to specify something that may not be there.  For this reason, `unit`s are commonly used for operations that sometimes fail, such as search functions, database lookups, remote data requests, etc.

You can build a `unit` using the tic special notation or [`++some`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2a#some):

```hoon
> `%mars
[~ %mars]

> (some %mars)
[~ u=%mars]
```

While `++got:by` is one way to get a value back without wrapping it in a `unit`, it's better practice to use the [`unit` logic](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2a) gates to manipulate gates to work correctly with `unit`s.

For example, use [`++need`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2a#need) to unwrap a `unit`, or crash if the `unit` is `~` null.

```hoon
> =colors (malt `(list (pair @tas @ux))`~[[%red 0xed.0a3f] [%yellow 0xfb.e870] [%green 0x1.a638] [%blue 0x66ff]])

> (~(get by colors) %yellow)
[~ q=0xfb.e870]

> (need (~(get by colors) %yellow))
0xfb.e870

> (~(get by colors) %teal)
~

> (need (~(get by colors) %teal))
dojo: hoon expression failed
```

Rather than unwrap a `unit`, one can modify gates to work with `unit`s directly even if they're not natively set up that way.  For instance, one cannot decrement a `unit` because `++dec` doesn't accept a `unit`.  [`++bind`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2a#bind) can bind a non-`unit` function—another gate-building gate!.

```hoon
> (bind ((unit @ud) [~ 2]) dec)  
[~ 1]

> (bind (~(get by colors) %orange) red)  
[~ 0xff]
```

(There are several others tools listed [on that page](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2a) which may be potentially useful to you.)

A `+$vase` is a pair of type and value, such as that returned by `!>` zapgar.  A `vase` is useful when transmitting data in a way that may lose its type information.

### Containers of Containers

`map`s and `set`s are frequently used in the standard library and in the extended ecosystem (such as in `graph-store`).  There are a some other common patterns which recur often enough that they have their own names:

- [`++jar`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2o#jar) is a mold for a `map` of `list`s.  `++jar` uses the [`++ja`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2j#ja) core.

- [`++jug`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2o#jug) is a mold for a `map` of `set`s.  `++jug` uses the  [`++ju`](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/stdlib/2j#ju) core.

- `++mip` is a mold for a map of maps.  `++mip` lives in the `%garden` desk in the Urbit repo in `/lib/mip.hoon`.  Affordances are still few and there are not currently docs on how to use `++mip`, but a short example follows:

    ```hoon
    > =mip -build-file /=garden=/lib/mip/hoon
    > =my-map-warm (malt `(list (pair @tas @ux))`~[[%red 0xed.0a3f] [%yellow 0xfb.e870]])
    > =my-map-cool (malt `(list (pair @tas @ux))`~[[%green 0x1.a638] [%blue 0x66ff]])
    > =my-mip *(mip:mip @tas (map @tas @ux))
    > =my-mip (~(put bi:mip my-mip) %cool %blue 0x66ff)
    > =my-mip (~(put bi:mip my-mip) %cool %green 0x1.a638)
    > =my-mip (~(put bi:mip my-mip) %warm %red 0xed.0a3f)
    > =my-mip (~(put bi:mip my-mip) %warm %yellow 0xfb.e870)
    > my-mip
    [ n=[p=%warm q=[n=[p=%yellow q=0xfb.e870] l=[n=[p=%red q=0xed.0a3f] l=~ r=~] r=~]]
      l=[n=[p=%cool q=[n=[p=%green q=0x1.a638] l=[n=[p=%blue q=0x66ff] l=~ r=~] r=~]] l=~ r=~]
      r=~
    ]

    > (~(got bi:mip my-mip) %cool %green)
    0x1.a638

    > ~(tap bi:mip my-mip)
    ~[
      [x=%warm y=%yellow v=0xfb.e870]
      [x=%warm y=%red v=0xed.0a3f]
      [x=%cool y=%green v=0x1.a638]
      [x=%cool y=%blue v=0x66ff]
    ]
    ```

    `mip`s are unjetted and quite slow but serve as a proof of concept.

- `++mop` ordered maps are discussed in [the App School guides](TODO).


##  Molds and Samples

### Modifying Gate Behavior

Sometimes you need to modify parts of a core (like a gate) on-the-fly to get the desired behavior.  For instance, if you are using `++roll` to calculate the multiplicative product of the elements of a list, this “just works”:

```hoon
> (roll `(list @ud)`~[10 12 14 16 18] mul)  
483.840
```

In contrast, if you do the same thing to a list of numbers with a fractional part (`@rs` floating-point values), the naïve operation will fail:

```hoon
> (roll `(list @rs)`~[.10 .12 .14 .16 .18] mul:rs)  
.0
```

Why is this?  Let's peek inside the gates and see.  Since we know a core is a cell of `[battery payload]`, let's take a look at the `payload`:

```hoon
> +:mul  
[[a=1 b=1] <46.hgz 1.pnw %140>]  
> +:mul:rs  
[[a=.0 b=.0] <21.hqd [r=?(%d %n %u %z) <51.qbt 123.zao 46.hgz 1.pnw %140>]>]
```

The correct behavior for `++mul:rs` is really to multiply starting from one, not zero, so that `++roll` doesn't wipe out the entire product.

### Custom Samples

In an earlier exercise we created a door with sample `[a=@ud b=@ud c=@ud]`.  If we investigated, we would find that the initial value of each is `0`, the bunt value of `@ud`.

```hoon
> +6:poly
[a=0 b=0 c=0]
```

What if we wish to define a door with a chosen sample value directly?  We can make use of the `$_` rune, whose irregular form is simply `_`.  To create the door `poly` with the sample set to have certain values in the Dojo, we would write

```unknown
> =poly |_  [a=_5 b=_4 c=_3]
++  quad
  |=  x=@ud
  (add (add (mul a (mul x x)) (mul b x)) c)
--

> (quad:poly 2)  
31
```

For our earlier example with `++roll`, if we wanted to set the default sample to have a different value than the bunt of the type, we could use `_` cab:

```hoon
> =mmul |=([a=_1 b=_1] (mul:rs a b))
> (roll `(list @rs)`~[.10 .12 .14 .16 .18] mmul)
> .483840
```

### Named Tuples

A named tuple is a structured collection of values with faces.  The [`$:` buccol](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/rune/buc#-buccol) rune forms a named tuple.  We use these implicitly in an irregular form when we specify the sample of a gate, as `|=([a=@ b=@] (add a b))` expands to a `$:` buccol expression for `[a=@ b=@]`.  Otherwise, we only need these if we are building a special type like a vector (e.g. with two components like an _x_ and a _y_).

### Structure Mode

Most Hoon expressions evaluate normally (that's what “normal” means), what we'll call _noun mode_ (or _normal mode_).  However, sample definitions and `+$` lusbuc mold specification arms evaluate in what is called _structure mode_.  (You may occasionally see this the older term “spec mode”.)  Structure mode expressions use a similar syntax to regular Hoon expressions but create structure definitions instead.

For instance, in eval mode if you use the irregular form `p=1` this is an irregular form of the [`^=` kettis](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/rune/ket#-kettis) rune.  This is one way to define a variable using a [`=+` tislus](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/rune/tis#-tislus); these are equivalent statements:

```hoon
> =+(hello=1 hello)
1

> =+(^=(hello 1) hello)
1
```

(Normally we have preferred [`=/` tisfas](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/rune/tis#-tisfas) in the Hoon School docs, but that is just for consistency.)

In a sample definition, such as in a gate, the statement is evaluated in structure mode; these are equivalent statements:

```hoon
|=(hello=@ hello)

|=($=(hello @) hello)
```

There are several other subtle cases where normal mode and structure mode diverge, but most of the time structure mode is invisible to you.  The [`$` buc runes](https://urbit.org/docs/hoon/reference/rune/buc) are typically invoked in structure mode.
